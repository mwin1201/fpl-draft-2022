# FPL Draft Website

## Description
This website is currently hardcoded to the FPL draft league I am playing in. In the future I will develop the website to allow
anyone to enter in their FPL draft ID and have their league data populate the website. This website shows data that is inaccessible 
or not easy to find on the official FPL app. Some of the best features are consolidated stats for each league player's starting 11
as well as consolidated season stats. This is a great way to see where teams are excelling and where they might need more work.
It definitely increases the competitiveness among the league.
